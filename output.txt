["1) If Canadians buy their milk in a bag, does that make them milk bagholders ? ðŸ¤”","2) Buying and holding more AMC. Can't wait to be on the moon with everyone ðŸ™‚","3) Most of my picks have been good most of the times. However selling my winners early and holding loser too late has been the main problem. Examples GME, AMC, SPCE, RKT, BB calls and UWMC puts, PLTR calls etc.","4) Remember kids, hold until portnoy tweets every man for himself","5) So AMC and GME bagholders get pain and suffering for months on end (congrats btw, not hating) but get rewarded with moon, meanwhile the rest of us suffer for months on end and are eating bbq sauce packets for dinner."]
