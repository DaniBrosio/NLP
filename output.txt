["1) BB, really??? 11.7 to 10.2?? You aren't going to hold onto any gains?","2) Paperhands of GME from 268 to this? Bagholders unite. Apes together broke.","3) Just don’t sell till it goes up. I don’t care if you have to wait a year. The market efficiently takes money from paper hands and short term option holders and transfers it to diamond hands and the patient.","4) Hey newer people. When someone says dont hold over the weekend there is a probably they are holding puts and trying to get sell momentum going. \n\nListen to yourrr heartttt when holding AMC","5) Seems like a bunch of PLTR bagholders are jealous that AMC crushed it this week","6) I bought and sold AMD from $78 sold at $77 at a loss, now it’s up big\n\nI bought and sold AMC from $19 sold at $7, now it’s up big.\n\nI bought TELL at $3.98 sold at $3.72 now it’s up big\n\nI bought WISH at $8.48 and sold at $7.95\n\nI bought PSFE at $12.97 sold at $11.34\n\nI bought CRSR at $32.31 sold at $32.03 \n\nI bought CLOV at $8.32 and sold at $7.72\n\nI bought CLF at $18.90 and sold at $18.33 now it’s up big\n\nI bought RSI at $12.80 sold at $12.23 \n\nAll these trades are one day holds or same day sells. All of these I expected a big red day after another big green day. \n\nI also lost on a bunch of smaller caps under $1b so I cannot mention them. \n\nAll these positions I always went all in to try and make 2-5% off them but I end up selling thinking a red day will make the loss worst.\n\nI am traumatized and I am severely depressed. If anyone has a play that can give me a turning point in life please give me it. Or pm me the ticker if its a smaller cap. I am in severe desperation and I am operating my life at a loss. I fucking hate this shit.","7) If the fact that absolutely every broker in the world are now changing their policies to let people vote on GME doesnt tell you that retail own an insane amount of shares then you re trully retarded.\nLike e-Toro or the biggest broker in Sweden or a freakin broker in Hong Kong would change their policy to let shareholders vote for the first time to satisfy a few hundred bagholders ?\n\nThis is the most traded/holded stock on the planet and it s a game changer."]
